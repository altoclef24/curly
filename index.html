  <p>The Laperm is a small to medium sized cat, with fur that ranges from soft waves to tight curls. Dispite their calm disposition, they are extremely playful and 
  energetic. They also have a very inquisitive side and love to know about everything that goes on around them. They thrive with a loving family and enjoy being lap cats.</p>
  <p>The first Laperm was discovered in a litter of regular cats in Oregon in 1986. One of the kittens was born bald, but within eight weeks, the kitten had grown soft curly fur. 
   By the time the kitten was three to four months old, it had a full coat of curly fur. This curly fur is found in all Laperms today.</p>
